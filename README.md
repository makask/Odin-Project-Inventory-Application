Project: Inventory Application
NodeJS Course

Assignment:
1. Create an Inventory management app for an imaginary store.
2. Inventory app should have categories and items, so when the user goes to the home-page they can choose a category to view, and then get a list of every item in that category.
3. You should include all of the CRUD methods for both items and categories, so anybody that’s visiting the site can Create, Read, Update or Delete any Item or Category.
4. Write down all of the models you’ll need and the fields that should go in them.
5. Items should at least have: a name, description, category, price, number-in-stock and URL.
6. Categories should at least have a name, a description and a URL.
7. Choose a templating language and generate the boilerplate skeleton with express-generator.
8. Create a new Mongo Collection using the web-interface as demonstrated in the tutorial and then set up your database schemas and models.
9. Set up the routes and controllers you’re going to need.

11. Create all the forms and build out the controllers you need for the rest of the CRUD actions.
